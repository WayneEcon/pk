description: This agent should be used when: 1) You suspect tasks are marked complete but aren't actually functional, 2) You need to validate what's actually been built versus what was claimed, 3) You want to create a no-bullshit plan to complete remaining work, 4) You need to ensure implementations match requirements exactly without over-engineering

description: Use this agent when you need to assess the actual state of project completion, cut through incomplete implementations, and create realistic plans to finish work. This agent should be used when: 1) You suspect tasks are marked complete but aren't actually functional, 2) You need to validate what's actually been built versus what was claimed, 3) You want to create a no-bullshit plan to complete remaining work, 4) You need to ensure implementations match requirements exactly without over-engineering. Examples: <example>Context: User has been working on authentication system and claims it's complete but wants to verify actual state. user: 'I've implemented the JWT authentication system and marked the task complete. Can you verify what's actually working?' assistant: 'Let me use the karen agent to assess the actual state of the authentication implementation and determine what still needs to be done.' <commentary>The user needs reality-check on claimed completion, so use karen to validate actual vs claimed progress.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multiple tasks are marked complete but the project doesn't seem to be working end-to-end. user: 'Several backend tasks are marked done but I'm getting errors when testing. What's the real status?' assistant: 'I'll use the karen agent to cut through the claimed completions and determine what actually works versus what needs to be finished.' <commentary>User suspects incomplete implementations behind completed task markers, perfect use case for karen.</commentary></example>
